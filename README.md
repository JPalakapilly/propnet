# Design Overview

Propnet is designed to synthesize all current materials science knowledge into a graph, that can be traversed to calculate additional properties when provided with some initial information.

## The Graph

As much as possible, information is encoded into the graph itself, rather than creating additional data structures. Rather than re-invent the wheel, we are using the popular and well-tested [networkx 2.0](https://networkx.github.io) graph library to provide the necessary data structures and graph algorithms that form the foundation of Propnet.


## Property

A 'property' refers to a property of a material, such as its lattice parameter, band gap or bulk modulus.

In Propnet, properties are rigorously defined to ensure consistent intepretations between different models, and this crucially includes explicit units and uncertainties. Where uncertainties are unknown, we apply rule-of-thumb uncertainties derived from statistical analysis of similar data to give a first-approximation of our confidence in a property.

In terms of implementation, a `Property` provides information on the property itself (e.g. lattice parameter has units of length), and a `PropertyInstance` is an object that combines a `Property` with a value (e.g. 5Ã…), a reference for where the property came from, and edges to the materials it is associated with.

## Material

There is a necessary distinction between a real 'material' vs. an ideal, perfect crystal. In the [Materials Project](http://materialsproject.org/)  a 'material' typically refers to the latter. However, properties can come from many sources, including experiment data where additional phases or impurities might be present.

Propnet attempts to gracefully handled this distinction. A `PropertyInstance` can have edges to the material it's associated with. In the simplest case, this could be an edge to a material defined simply by its chemical formula. If the structure is known, it is represented by a [pymatgen](https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen) `Structure` object.

To illustrate, a `PropertyInstance` of a lattice parameter calculated using DFT, would have an edge to a `PropertyInstance` representing a temperature of 0 K, and an edge to the `Structure` associated with it. In this caes, the edge weight to the `Structure` would be 1.0, since this is an ideal, perfect material.

However, if the `PropertyInstance` came from experimental data and a second impurity phase is present, it would have edges to *two* `Structure` objects, with the edge for the majority phase given a weight of, e.g., 0.99 (if it was 99% pure), and the second edge with a weight of 0.01 for the impurity phase.

In the case of a property where there is a *relationship* between `Structure` objects, such as a lattice misfit, then an edge is added between the two `Structure` objects specifiying this relationship, i.e. the orientation relationship.

## Models

A model specifies:

* A list of all Properties it uses
* A list of Properties it can output
* A master equation, specified symbolically using [SymPy](http://www.sympy.org)
* A mapping of symbols in the master equation to their canonical Property names
* A list of `Conditions` for each sympol
* A list of `Assumptions` associated with the model output

Initially, we are supporting analytical models only. However, as the project progresses we expect to support the following machine learning models:

* Neural networks (feedforward, convolutional, recurrent) via Caffe or Keras
* Scikit-learn models (tree ensembles, support vector machines, generalized linear models, feature engineering, pipeline models)

Models must be serialized to an appropriate format and provide a consistent interface. Initially, we will figure this out on a case-by-case basis, and likely include a plug-in interface for external projects.

## Conditions and Assumptions

The specific implementation here will likely change.

An `Assumption` can be something like:

* An `IsotropicAssumption`, assumes a material is isotropic
* A `Temperature(300)`, assumes an experimental measurement was taken at room temperature

A `Condition` can be something like:

* A Property might require a `Temperature(0)` condition, e.g. a model will expect a lattice parameter defined at 0 K.

If a model has inputs where it is unknown if they satisfy its conditions (e.g. a lattice parameter property exists in the graph, but the temperature it was measured at is not specified), then it becomes an `Assumption` in the model output.

## Propagation of references and assumptions

Any reference or `Assumption` associated with a `PropertyInstance` is propagated through the model and through the graph, so that when the graph is queried for the specific value of a property, the assumptions and a list of references are also supplied, in addition to the value of the property itself.


# Guidelines for Contributions

Properties and models each have their own distinct file, to make it easier to version models and properly credit the people who made them. When necessary, we will use the git short hash to refer to a specific version of a model, though in most cases models should be fixed once created.

## Submitting a Property

Please copy an existing property and submit a pull request, its filename should match the canonical name of the property. Properties are defined in [YAML](http://yaml.org) syntax.

Key fields are as follows:

* `canonical_name`: A unique name for the property, lowercase, must be a valid Python identifier (no spaces)
* `unit`: A list of of lists, from [pint's serialization format](http://pint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/serialization.html), with an implicit value of 1.0 (see examples)
* `display_names`: List of human-readable name(s), LaTeX syntax allowed, first name will be the preferred name
* `display_symbols`: As above, but for symbols
* `dimension`: The expected dimension (using the same definition as [numpy ndarray shape](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.shape.html)) of the property. If there are multiple ways to define the property (e.g. vector, scalar), define multiple properties with a simple model to convert between them.
* `test_value`: A physically-plausible test value in the units specified above, 

## Submitting a Model

Please copy an existing model and submit a pull request, its filename should match the canonical name of the property. Any additional code/resources necessary for the model to work should go in the folder `../supplementary/model_name/`.

# Web Interface

Each model and property will have an auto-generated page associated with them. This page will allow manual input of model parameters and calculation of model outputs, and will also provide documentation/explanations of how the model works. On a technological level, this will make use of the [Dash library by plot.ly](https://plot.ly/products/dash/).

When contributing a model, to add additional documentation please place a Markdown file with the canonical model name in the `../models/docs/` directory.

# FAQ

All this is subject to change, since we're still at the design stage. Until documentation is written, please find some answers to common questions:

Q. How does this differ to tensor graph libraries such as PyTorch and Tensorflow?
A. These libraries are excellent tools for creating tensor graphs, but have different design goals and are only superficially similar. Whereas a single node in these tensor graph libraries is a mathematical operation, in our graph a node contains an entire mathematical model and associated metadata, including references. It also gracefully handles propagation of units and uncertainties. As such, Propnet is designed at a much higher-level than these other libraries: a single node in propnet could itself be an entire Tensorflow neural network. Due to this design, Propnet will also have an order of magnitude fewer nodes than a typical Tensorflow graph, so allows for a simpler implementation.
